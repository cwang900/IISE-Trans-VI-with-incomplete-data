There is one R file to replicate the results of Fig. 4 in the manuscript. The code includes all stages of data generation, model fitting, and monitoring. The running of the whole code takes ~10 hours (tested on R 4.2.2 under Windows 10, 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1260P   2.10 GHz with 16 GB RAM).
The output of the code is a 2-by-2 figure that reproduces the Fig. 4 in the manuscript.
 

Please open the R file and run the code for reproduction of results.

All the required libraries are determined in the code. 

To reproduce the results in the paper, some values such as seeds, quantiles (ARL_func funtion) are 
preset and they can be changed for desired settings.
